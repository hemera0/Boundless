# Boundless
Bindless HLSL &amp; Vulkan Renderer

Boundless is a small project I have been waiting to work on while Microsoft has been slowly been improving the `vk::BufferPointer<T>` type allowing for easier to use bindless resources when using HLSL with Vulkan. This project serves as a proof of concept for that functionality.
